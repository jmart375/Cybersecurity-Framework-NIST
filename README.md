## NIST Cybersecurity Framework
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity risk management processes. 

The NIST CSF provides a flexible and voluntary framework that organizations can use to assess and enhance their cybersecurity posture. It is designed to be applicable to a wide range of organizations, regardless of size, sector, or cybersecurity maturity. The framework emphasizes risk management and focuses on helping organizations identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats and incidents.
